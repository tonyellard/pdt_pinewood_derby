# Pinewood Derby Timer Related Files

This repository contains the code/files required to run a Pinewood Derby Timer using PDT and DerbyNet. In case these original sources are made unavailable in the future, I've copied them here for safe-keeping. I've also added in my notes and changes, 3D models, etc. as applicable.

## PDT

When building the pinewood derby timer, the base ideas came from the PDT project from dfgtec.com. PDT is an open sourced pinewood derby timer framework for Arduino. The original source and instructions can be found here: https://github.com/tonyellard/pinewood-derby-timer-build

## Derbynet

Derbynet is an open source Race software. This software can be used to run derby races, manage racers/cars, and track results. There are many additional features of this product, but we're currently only focusing on the base functionality of running a race and tracking the results.

Derbynet's home is linked to from the PDT documentation and can also be found here: http://jeffpiazza.github.io/derbynet/
